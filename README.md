## My GitHub Pages Website
This repository hosts a simple static website deployed using GitHub Pages. The site features a clean, responsive design with HTML and CSS, showcasing a centered container with a heading, paragraph, and a styled button.

### Live Website
The website is live at: https://your-username.github.io/my-github-pages-site \
(Replace your-username and my-github-pages-site with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)
### Repository Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the website structure and inline CSS.
- styles.css: An external stylesheet for additional or overriding styles.
- README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

### Setup Instructions
To deploy this website on your own GitHub Pages:

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-github-pages-site.git
cd my-github-pages-site
```

2. Add or Modify Files:
- Ensure index.html and styles.css are in the root directory.
- Customize index.html or styles.css as needed.


3. Commit and Push Changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add or update website files"
git push origin main
```

4. Enable GitHub Pages:
- Go to the repository on GitHub → Settings → Pages.
- Set Source to "Deploy from a branch," select the main branch, and choose the / (root) folder.
- Save the settings.


5. Access the Site:
- Find the live URL in the Pages settings (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/my-github-pages-site).
- Visit the URL to view the site. It may take a few minutes to deploy initially.



### Customization

- CSS Styling: Modify styles.css to change the site’s appearance (e.g., colors, fonts, or layout).
- Additional Pages: Add new HTML files (e.g., about.html) and link them from index.html.
- Assets: Include images or JavaScript files in the repository for enhanced functionality.

### Troubleshooting

- Site Not Loading: Verify that index.html is in the root of the main branch and GitHub Pages is enabled.

- CSS Not Applying: Check for 404 errors in the browser’s developer tools (F12) to ensure styles.css is loading correctly.

- Deployment Delay: Allow a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy changes after pushing to the repository.
